SETTING UP A REACT ENVIRONMENT

If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by first installing the create-react-app.
Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal:

- C:\Users\Your Name>npm install -g create-react-app

Then you are able to create a React application, let's create one called myfirstreact.
Run this command to create a React application named myfirstreact:

- C:\Users\Your Name>npx create-react-app myfirstreact

The create-react-app will setup everything you need to run a React application.

RUN THE REACT APPLICATION
Now you are ready to run your first real React application!
Run this command to move to the myfirstreact directory:

- C:\Users\Your Name>cd myfirstreact

Run this command to run the React application myfirstreact:

- C:\Users\Your Name\myfirstreact>npm start
